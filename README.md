# Thread Safe Hashmap

This code was written for a university assignment.

It implemments a thread safe hashmap that can be used along with multi threading programs.

This hashmap employs medium-level mutex locks which ensure effieciency while also guaranteeing the desired results.

The hashmap automatically resizes to try to maintain constant running times on insert and search requests.
